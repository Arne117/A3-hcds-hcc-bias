## Data sources

## Special considerations

## Replication
### Getting started

We use the  "Amazing Python Data Workflow with Poetry, Pandas, and Jupyter"<sup>[1]</sup> to make sure everyone in the course uses the same environment and we don't run into any dependency hell.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have a Python version greater or equal to `3.9`, a working installation of Poetry and git installed.
### Setup

```sh
# 1. Clone this repository (or use SSH) and move it into the repo root
git clone https://github.com/Arne117/A3-hcds-hcc-bias.git
cd A3-hcds-hcc-bias

# 2. Install the dependencies in the repo root
poetry install

# 3. Create a subshell within the virtual environment by running:
poetry shell

# 4. Open the project with Jupyter in your browser.
jupyter notebook
```
